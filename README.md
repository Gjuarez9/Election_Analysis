# Election_Analysis

### OVERVIEW

Work with the election comission to assist in an electoral audit. Have been asked to assist with gathering voting turnout per county, percentage county vote out of the total number of votes and finding the county with the highest turnout.

### ANALYSIS RESULTS

With the ability to perform this analysis using python we are able to discover the answers for all of our requests.

  * The total number of votes cast. **369,711**
  * Percentage for each county.  **Jefferson, 10.5% - Denver, 82.8% - Arapahoe, 6.7%**
  * Which county had the largest number of votes.  **Denver**
  * The total number of votes each candidate received.  **DeGette, 272,892 - Stockham, 85,213 - Doanne, 11,606**
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won.  **DeGette, 73.8% - Stockham, 23% - Doanne, 3.1%**

### SUMMARY

It is clear that our code was able to execute this task in a timely and unbiased manner. In order to be able to repurpose this code for future audits of a similar nature we can look to add pieces of code that also separate or group votes per gender, dempographic or any other social group one may be curious about. This would of course requre to have our original file to have the necessary fields to complete this. Another thing that can be improved upon is the presentation of our findings. Yes numbers help but perhaps some visuals could be more insightful and impactful to analyze such as graphs and charts.
